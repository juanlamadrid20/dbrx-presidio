    "This notebook demonstrates how to leverage DBRX models for fake/surrogate data generation. It uses Presidio to first de-identify data (as de-identification might be required prior to passing the model to DBRX), and then uses DBRX completion models to create synthetic/fake/surrogate data based on real data. DBRX models would also potentially remove additional PII entities, if those are not detected by Presidio.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some impressions:\n",
    "1. DBRX sometimes gives additonal output, especially if the text is a question or concerning a human/bot interaction. Engineering the prompt can mitigate some of these issues. Potential post-processing might be required.\n",
    "2. DBRX sometimes creates fake values even in the absence of placeholders.\n",
    "3. DBRX re-uses context from other sentences, which could cause phone numbers are sometimes generated using a credit card pattern or other similar mistakes.\n",
    "4. Co-references are sometimes missed (i.e. two name placeholders that should be filled with the same name, or referencing he/she to a male/female name)"
